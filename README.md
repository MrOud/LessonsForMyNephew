# LessonsForMyNephew
My nephew, Ethan, lives on the other side of the continent. So this is a common workspace for us to learn about computers together.
Inspired by the Eudyptula Challenge (http://eudyptula-challenge.org/). This is going to be a series of challenges to teach programming and some other good to know skills.

Task 01: 
Hey Ethan, so this is your first task. Install git and clone this project, and add a file called TODO.txt, and in that tell me which editor you used to create that file. 
Commit the changes, and upload it. Here's a quick tutorial about how to use github. You can use either the desktop application or the command line to do this.
